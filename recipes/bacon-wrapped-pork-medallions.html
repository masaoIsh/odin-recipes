  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This recipe for pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon is a variation of a recipe my mother used to make with my own spin on the seasonings. It's also one of our favorites to enjoy around the holidays!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon seasoning salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>8 slices bacon</li>
    <li>2 pounds pork tenderloin</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine garlic powder, seasoning salt, basil, and oregano in a small bowl.</li>
    <li>Cook bacon in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until lightly browned and still flexible, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Drain any excess bacon grease from the skillet.</li>
    <li>Wrap four slices bacon around each tenderloin, securing each strip with 1 to 2 toothpicks. Slice tenderloins between each bacon strip to create a total of eight medallions. Dip medallions into seasoning mix on both sides.</li>
    <li>Melt butter and oil together in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add medallions and cook for 4 minutes on each side.</li>
    <li>Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake until pork is no longer pink in the center, 17 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
  </ol>
